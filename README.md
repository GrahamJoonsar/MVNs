# MVNs
A tool for using multi-valued numbers while programming.

## main.cpp
This file contains a class for MVNs which supports the four basic operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), a function that returns the degree of an MVN (number of possibilities), a function that returns the MVN in the form of a string, and a static function that returns the nth basis MVN.
